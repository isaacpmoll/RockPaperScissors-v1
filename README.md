##Rock, Paper, Scissors
Program Rock.py contains a skeleton for the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Add statements to the program as indicated by the comments so that the program asks the user to enter a play, generates a random play for the computer, compares them and announces the winner (and why). For example, one run of your program might look like this:

Enter your play: R, P, or S
r
Computer play is S
Rock crushes scissors, you win!
Note:
* The user should be able to enter either upper or lower case r, p, and s. The user's play is stored as a string to make it easy to convert whatever is entered to upper case using the upper() method or the lower() method. 
	
* Use an if statement to convert the randomly generated integer for the computer's play to a string.
